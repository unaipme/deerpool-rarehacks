1;Melanoma skin tumours appear from abnormal pigment cells that have become cancer cells. These tumours are generally brown or black in colour because the cells still make melanin, but they can also be skin-coloured, pink or white. ;;
2;The main preventable cause of melanoma is overexposure to UV radiation from the sun. There are many risk factors that increase the chances of melanoma, including people with fair skin, a high mole count and family history. Importantly, melanoma can occur anywhere on the skin, even in areas that receive little or no sun exposure e.g. inside the mouth or on the soles of your feet. ;;
3;"Symptoms of melanoma include a change in a mole, or a new mole that has ABCDE traits such as:
Asymmetry. One half of the mole does not match the other half.
Border irregularity. The edges of the mole are ragged or irregular.
Color. The mole has different colors in it. It may be tan, brown, black, red, or other colors. Or it may have areas that appear to have lost color.
Diameter. The mole is bigger than 6 millimeters across, about the size of a pencil eraser. But some melanomas can be smaller.
Evolving. A mole changes in size, shape, or color.                                                                                                      Other symptoms of melanoma can include a mole that:
Itches or hurts
Oozes, bleeds, or becomes crusty
Turns red or swells
Looks different from your child's other moles";;
4;After your treatment is over, it is very important to keep all follow-up appointments. After having had melanoma, you are at risk of your melanoma returning (recurrence), as well as developing a new melanoma. You may also experience side effects as a result of your treatments.

6;Our risk of melanoma certainly is hereditary - it is strongly affected by our genetic background. Rarely, a specific faulty gene that causes high melanoma risk may be passed from one generation to the next. But for most people it is the combination of a lot of genetic differences that pushes our risk up or down: such as our different skin colours, the way we react to the sun, the number of our moles, and other invisible effects of our genetic makeup.;;
7;There are many things that you can do that Will be helpful. It is very important to avoid exposure to ultraviolet radiation and continue to examine your skin every month for detecting possible new skin cancers.

8;Your doctor will do a physical examination to check all parts of your skin including your hands and feet, inside you mouth and nose and your scalp. They might use a magnifying instrument called a dermoscope to refine their diagnosis. If they find something they’re uncertain about you might be referred to a dermatologist. But if they find something suspicious they’ll recommend you have a biopsy.;;
9;An excision biopsy is a quick and simple procedure that can be done by your GP, dermatologist or a surgeon. You will be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area. Then your doctor will use a scalpel to remove the mole and some surrounding tissue. The wound will probably be closed with a couple stitches. The sample will be sent to pathology.;;
10;After you receive a diagnosis of melanoma, your doctor will discuss a treatment plan for you based on a number of factors, including the stage of your disease, the type, the location, your age, and general health. Treatments are available for all people with melanoma. Early stage melanoma can often be treated effectively with surgery alone, while more advanced melanomas may require surgery as well as additional treatments such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy.  There are also a variety of new treatments and new combinations being investigated in clinical trials, which are research studies to evaluate new therapies and improve cancer care.;;

14;Surgery is the most common treatment for melanoma, however its purpose varies depending on how far the cancer has progressed. For later stage melanoma, surgery is used as a diagnostic tool to assess how far the cancer has spread. Patients may require more invasive surgery to remove lymph nodes.;;
15;"Melanoma is likely to cause complications. And the more advanced the cancer, the more likely there will be complications.
Complications may result from treatment, such as:
Loss of large areas of skin and underlying tissue
Scarring
Problems with the area healing
Infection in the area
Damage to nerves
Return of the skin cancer after treatment";;

27;"The Skin Cancer Foundation advise you to:
Limit how much sun your child gets between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Use broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. Put it on the skin of children older than 6 months of age who are exposed to the sun.
Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours, even on cloudy days. Reapply after swimming.
Use extra caution near water, snow, and sand. They reflect the damaging rays of the sun. This can increase the chance of sunburn.
Make sure your child wears clothing that covers the body and shades the face. Hats should provide shade for both the face, ears, and back of the neck. Wearing sunglasses will reduce the amount of rays reaching the eye and protect the lids of the eyes, as well as the lens.
Don’t let your child use or be around sunlamps or tanning beds.";;
