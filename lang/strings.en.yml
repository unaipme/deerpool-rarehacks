      n-1: "*Melanoma skin tumours* appear from abnormal pigment cells that have become cancer cells. These tumours are generally brown or black in colour because the cells still make melanin, but they can also be skin-coloured, pink or white."
      n-2: "The main preventable cause of _melanoma_ is *overexposure to UV radiation from the sun*. There are many risk factors that increase the chances of _melanoma_, including people with fair skin, a high mole count and family history. Importantly, _melanoma_ can occur anywhere on the skin, even in areas that receive little or no sun exposure e.g. inside the mouth or on the soles of your feet."
      n-3: "Symptoms of _melanoma_ include a change in a mole, or a new mole that has ABCDE traits such as:\n∙ *Asymmetry*. One half of the mole does not match the other half.\n∙ *Border irregularity*. The edges of the mole are ragged or irregular.\n∙ *Color*. The mole has different colors in it. It may be tan, brown, black, red, or other colors. Or it may have areas that appear to have lost color.\n∙ *Diameter*. The mole is bigger than 6 millimeters across, about the size of a pencil eraser. But some melanomas can be smaller.\n∙ *Evolving*. A mole changes in size, shape, or color.\nOther symptoms of melanoma can include a mole that itches or hurts.\n∙ Oozes, bleeds, or becomes crusty.\n∙ Turns red or swells. Looks different from your child's other moles."
      n-4: "After your treatment is over, it is very important to keep all follow-up appointments. After having had _melanoma_, you are at risk of your _melanoma_ returning (recurrence), as well as developing a new _melanoma_. You may also experience side effects as a result of your treatments. This is the time for you to ask your health care team any questions you need answered and to discuss any concerns you might have."
      n-5: "If you see a strange new mole on your skin or an old mole that’s started changing be sure to see your doctor right away, because an early diagnosis makes a big difference. Find out what to look for and how to do a self examination in the [Preventing Melanoma](https://www.melanoma.org.au/preventing-melanoma/)"
      n-6: "Our risk of _melanoma_ certainly is hereditary - it is strongly affected by our genetic background. Rarely, a specific faulty gene that causes high _melanoma_ risk may be passed from one generation to the next. But for most people it is the combination of a lot of genetic differences that pushes our risk up or down: such as our different skin colours, the way we react to the sun, the number of our moles, and other invisible effects of our genetic makeup."
      n-7: "There are many things that you can do that will be helpful. It is very important to avoid exposure to ultraviolet radiation and continue to examine your skin every month for detecting possible new skin cancers. Also, you should adopt healthy behaviours as not smoking, eating well, beaning active and staying at a healthy weight. For more information look at: [_Melanoma_ follow-up ACS](https://www.melanoma.org.au/preventing-melanoma/)"
      n-8: "Your doctor will do a physical examination to check all parts of your skin including your hands and feet, inside you mouth and nose and your scalp. They might use a magnifying instrument called a dermoscope to refine their diagnosis. If they find something they’re uncertain about you might be referred to a dermatologist. But if they find something suspicious they’ll recommend you have a biopsy."
      n-9: "An excision biopsy is a quick and simple procedure that can be done by your GP, dermatologist or a surgeon. You will be given a local anaesthetic to numb the area. Then your doctor will use a scalpel to remove the mole and some surrounding tissue. The wound will probably be closed with a couple stitches. The sample will be sent to pathology."
      n-10: "After you receive a diagnosis of _melanoma_, your doctor will discuss a treatment plan for you based on a number of factors, including the stage of your disease, the type, the location, your age, and general health. Treatments are available for all people with _melanoma_. Early stage _melanoma_ can often be treated effectively with surgery alone, while more advanced melanomas may require surgery as well as additional treatments such as immunotherapy or targeted therapy.  There are also a variety of new treatments and new combinations being investigated in clinical trials, which are research studies to evaluate new therapies and improve cancer care."
      n-11: "After the surgery the your healthcare team will continue to check that the cancer has not come back, it also depends on the stage of your _melanoma_. Also you should revise the next web to be best informed: [_Melanoma_: Follow-Up Care](https://www.cancer.net/cancer-types/melanoma/follow-care)"
      n-12: "Check every part of your skin at least once a month, looking for any new or changing marks. Also make sure you have regular checkups with your doctor."

You can find more information at [Aids for cancer Spain](https://www.aecc.es/es/todo-sobre-cancer/viviendo-con-cancer/ayudas-practicas) or calling to the following telephone number"
      n-14: "Surgery is the most common treatment for _melanoma_, however its purpose varies depending on how far the cancer has progressed. For later stage _melanoma_, surgery is used as a diagnostic tool to assess how far the cancer has spread. Patients may require more invasive surgery to remove lymph nodes."
      n-15: "_Melanoma_ is likely to cause complications. And the more advanced the cancer, the more likely there will be complications. Complications may result from treatment, such as:\n∙ Loss of large areas of skin and underlying tissue\n∙ Scarring\n∙ Problems with the area healing\n∙ Infection in the area\n∙ Damage to nerves\n∙ Return of the skin cancer after treatment"
      n-16: "Every time you go outside, wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which protects against UVA and UVB rays. It should have an SPF of at least 30."
      n-17: "Don't spend much time outside between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun and its piercing ultraviolet (UV) rays are strongest. You should wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which protects against UVA and UVB rays. It should have an SPF of at least 30. Reapply at least every 2 hours, and more often if you're swimming, sweating, or spending time near water. Be extra careful if you’re taking \"photosensitive\" drugs, which make you more sensitive to the sun."

It is also used to prevent melanoma from coming back after surgery, including lymph node removal surgery. Yervoy is also used to treat kidney cancer, sometimes given with another medicine called nivolumab (Opdivo). Yervoy is also used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, that has certain specific DNA mutations, and that has not responded to chemotherapy with other medicines.\nYou must not take it without medical prescription due to its possible side effects\nFor further information follow the next link"
